# **App Name**: NextIntlTyped

## Core Features:

- Type-Safe Translation: Provides enhanced TypeScript typing for next-intl's translation system.
- Custom `raw()` Wrapper: Offers a custom wrapper around next-intl's `raw()` method for improved type safety and autocomplete.
- Dynamic Key Support: Enables type-safe dynamic translation keys using `ChildKeySegments<T>` to prevent runtime errors.
- Locale Switching: Implements language switching between English and German to test internationalization.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to convey stability and trust in the translations.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), subtly desaturated to ensure text readability and visual comfort.
- Accent color: Teal (#38b2ac) to highlight key interactive elements such as language switch buttons and important notifications, standing out yet harmonizing with the blue theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, consistent icons from a set like Feather or Tabler to represent settings, language options, and other key elements.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout using Tailwind CSS to ensure responsiveness and clarity across different screen sizes.
- Implement subtle transitions for language switching to provide a smooth, user-friendly experience.
